# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was asked by Stripe.
# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words,
# find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
# You can modify the input array in-place.

def plus_petit(k):
    list_pure = []
    for i in k:
        if i >= 1:
            list_pure.append(i)
    for i in range(1, max(list_pure)):
        if i not in list_pure:
            return i
    return max(list_pure)+1

k = [1, 2, 0]
print(plus_petit(k))
